# Inference Package - Example App

This example app demonstrates the Inference Flutter package with comprehensive validation tests and interactive showcases.

## 📚 Documentation

**For complete documentation and implementation details, see [docs/](./docs/)**:
- [📋 Business Requirements](./docs/EXAMPLE_BRD.md) - App vision and specifications
- [🎨 UI Architecture](./docs/UI_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Design system and components  
- [🗺️ Implementation Roadmap](./docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) - Development plan

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Current Status: Basic Validation
The app currently runs validation tests for the core library functionality:
- 3-line usage promise validation
- Engine auto-detection testing
- Input type validation (Image, NLP, Tensor, Audio)
- Error handling verification

### Planned: Comprehensive Showcase
The full implementation will include 8 interactive sections demonstrating every library feature.

```bash
cd example
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The app will automatically run validation tests and display results.

## 🔧 Development

To implement the comprehensive showcase:

1. **Review Documentation**: Read the [docs/](./docs/) folder for complete specifications
2. **Follow Roadmap**: Use the 10-day implementation plan in [IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](./docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)
3. **Start with Phase 1**: Begin with foundation and core structure

## 🎯 Current Features

- Basic validation testing UI
- Engine availability checking  
- Input type validation
- Error handling demonstration
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

## 🚀 Planned Features

The full showcase will include:
- 📸 **Image Processing**: Live camera, upload, batch processing
- 🔤 **NLP Processing**: Real-time sentiment analysis, text classification
- 🎵 **Audio Processing**: Recording, waveform visualization, classification
- 📊 **Tensor Operations**: Custom models, tensor visualization, math operations
- 🧠 **On-Device Training**: K-means, regression, SVM with interactive plots
- ⚙️ **Engine Comparison**: Performance benchmarks, feature matrix
- 🔧 **Developer Tools**: Code examples, API reference, troubleshooting

This example serves as both a validation tool and a comprehensive showcase of the Inference library's capabilities.
