Rust implementation must follow exact BRD specifications:

TRAITS STRUCTURE:
- InferenceEngine trait: load_model(), load_from_bytes(), supports_format(), engine_name()
- Model trait: predict(), predict_batch(), input_specs(), output_specs()
- All traits must be Send + Sync

ENGINE IMPLEMENTATIONS:
- CandleEngine: Handle .safetensors, .pt, .pth files
- LinfaEngine: Handle on-device training with Dataset creation

DEPENDENCIES (exact versions):
- candle-core = "0.8" with cuda, mkl features
- linfa = "0.7" with all algorithm crates
- flutter_rust_bridge = "2.0"

AUTO-DETECTION LOGIC:
- File extension mapping: .safetensors/.pt/.pth â†’ Candle
- Content-based detection: SafeTensors JSON ({)
- Default fallback to Candle

ERROR HANDLING:
- Use thiserror for structured errors
- Specific error types: ModelLoad, Prediction, UnsupportedFormat, InvalidShape
- Proper error propagation across FFI boundary

NEVER use different ML libraries or create custom implementations.
